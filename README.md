# Robotic Arm Simulation (3-Link)
This repository features a physics-based simulation of a 3-link robotic arm, designed for comprehensive controller testing.

## Key Features:
- **Model Validation:** The robotic arm model has been rigorously validated using energy conservation principles to ensure accuracy and reliability.

- **Controller Implementation:** Various control techniques, including feedforward and optimal control, have been implemented to enhance the arm's performance.

- **Trajectory Tracking:** The current functionality involves the arm attempting to follow a predefined joint space trajectory.

## Future Work:
- **Inverse Kinematics Implementation:** Future updates will include the implementation of inverse kinematics, adding flexibility and expanding the range of possible applications.

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Plans are in place to incorporate real-time tracking capabilities, further enhancing the simulation's practicality and relevance.
